Set up complex stock configurations with ease. Shared stock, variable quantities, the possibilities are endless.

== Description ==

**WooCommerce Attribute Stock** gives your stock superpowers by allowing you to share inventories between multiple products/variations, or deduct different amounts of stock for each purchase of a product, variation, or attribute.

Easily track and manage shared stock, variable quantities, product addons, combo packs, measurements, components, and much more!

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è LITE VERSION LIMITATIONS ‚ö†Ô∏è

**This is a FREE LITE VERSION for testing and limited use. Most importantly, it does not affect frontend product stock or prevent over-purchasing. It can however be used to track internal attribute stock without affecting product availability. For all features listed below, please purchase the [FULL VERSION](https://codecanyon.net/item/woocommerce-attribute-stock/25796765).**

#### What problem does Attribute Stock solve?

If you've used WooCommerce for a little while, you know its stock capabilities are quite limited. Each product or product variation can have a stock quantity and that's about it. Essentially your products are your stock items.

This works fine when you're selling simple products, but as soon as you need to do things like share stock between multiple products, or deduct variable amounts of stock quantities per sale, you're out of luck.

#### How does Attribute Stock solve this?

Attribute Stock extends WooCommerce's stock functionality by adding a few essential features like [stock items](https://wcas-docs.mewz.dev/attribute-stock) based on attributes instead of product listings, allowing them to be used easily across multiple products. And versatile [stock multipliers](https://wcas-docs.mewz.dev/stock-multipliers) to control the amount of stock deducted for each purchase of a product, variation, attribute term, or stock item.

Whether you make use of powerful attribute stock items, or stick to using product stock with variable multipliers, your stock quantities will be accurately tracked, product availability will be appropriately displayed, and over-purchasing will be prevented.

### ‚ú® Plugin Features

### üß© Usage Examples

#### Example #1 ‚Äì Variable Stock ([Demo](https://wcas-demo.mewz.dev/wp-admin/post.php?post=69&action=edit))

Let's say you sell tea in packs of different weights. You can simply set your total tea stock at the product level and specify a **stock multiplier** on each product variation. The respective amount will be deducted from your total stock for each purchase. If you need to share variable stock across more than one product listing, you can use **attribute stock items** instead.

#### Example #2 ‚Äì Multiple Attributes ([Demo](https://wcas-demo.mewz.dev/wp-admin/post.php?post=127&action=edit))

Often your stock will have more than one attribute, such as t-shirts with different **sizes** and **colors**. In this case it's trivial to create **attribute stock items** with rules to match any combination of attributes across any number of products.

#### Example #3 ‚Äì Product Bundles ([Demo](https://wcas-demo.mewz.dev/wp-admin/post.php?post=369&action=edit))

Sometimes you'll want to sell several **individual products** as well as a **bundle** of these products for a discount. Since attributes can be added to products as variation or non-variation attributes, you can easily create stock items that are shared between all types of products.

#### Example #4 ‚Äì Component Stock ([Demo](https://wcas-demo.mewz.dev/wp-admin/edit.php?s=candle&post_type=attribute_stock))

In some cases you might need to track stock items made from other stock items. For example, let's say you design and sell hand-painted candles. By setting your plain candle stock as a component of your painted candle stock, you can track and sell each separately while allowing your painted candles to use the additional stock quantity of your plain candles.

Component stock is a powerful feature that can be used for many other advanced stock requirements such as batches and even stock from multiple suppliers. Learn more about how it works in our documentation below.
